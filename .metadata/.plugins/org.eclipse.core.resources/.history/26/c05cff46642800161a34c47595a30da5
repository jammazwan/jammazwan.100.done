# Jammazwan.shared

This project provides a set of base data feeds in various forms, for other jammazwan projects to consume.

### How This Project Is To Be Used

Do not use this project except when advised to do so by another project.

It has no useful code by itself. It is only meant to be a dependency of another project.

### Why Put Entity Objects (and related) in a Dependency Project?

In that sense, it's like a parent project in maven. Only it is a sibling. Parent projects can quickly weave themselves into a matrix of spaghetti projects, so this just forces things to remain simple and one to one.
